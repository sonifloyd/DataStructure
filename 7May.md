# A pivot element to partition unsorted list is used in
The quick sort partitions an array using pivot element and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the resulting
two subarray.
# Linked list search complexity is -o(n)
# Shell sort uses -insertion sort
Shell sort uses insertion sort when interval value is 1.
# In doubly linked lists- One pointer variable can not store more than one address values.
#  Index of arrays in C programming langauge starts from-0
# Which of these alogrithmic approach tries to achieve localized optimum solution −
Greedy approach focuses only on localized optimum solution.
# The following formula will produce
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
Fibonacci Series generates subsequent number by adding two previous numbers.
# From a complete graph, by removing maximum _______________ edges, we can construct a spanning tree.
We can remove maximum e-n+1 edges to get a spanning tree from complete graph
# A queue data-structure can be used for − resource allocation
Queues can be used for limited resource allocation. For other operations, stacks are used.
# Which of the below given sorting techniques has highest best-case runtime complexity −
Selection sort best case time complexity is Ο(n2)
# Which of the following algorithm does not divide the list − linear search
Linear search, seaches the desired element in the target list in a sequential manner, without breaking it in any way.
# Visiting root node after visiting left and right sub-trees is called
In Post-order traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name.
# push() and pop() functions are found in- stack
# All possible spanning trees of graph G
All possible spanning trees of graph G, have same number of edges and vertices.
# Quick sort running time depends on the selection of- pivot element
If the pivot element is balanced, quick sort running time will be less.
# If we choose Prim's Algorithm for uniquely weighted spanning tree instead of Kruskal's Algorithm, then-we ll get 
same spanning tree
Regardless of which algorithm is used, in a graph with unique weight, resulting spanning tree will be same.
#  In a min heap- In a min heap, parent nodes store lesser values than child nodes. 
The minimum value of the entire heap is stored at root.
